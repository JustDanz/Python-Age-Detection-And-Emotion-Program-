# Age And Emotion Detection With Python

Hello This is a project that I developed using the Python programming language where this program when run will turn on the webcam to capture the face where later when the webcam is on there will appear a red border containing information about emotions and age from us although it is less accurate because I am still learning to develop for Age Detection and its accuracy can be said to be 30 - 50%
